_If you haven’t already tried one, here are the reasons why you should get your fishing shirt: sun protection, comfortable and durable quality, odor-resistant, breathable fabric, moisture-wicking properties._

## <a name="MadeOf">What are fishing shirts made of?</a>

They come in Polyester, Nylon, Cotton material, and fabric that wicks moisture. The shirts include UPF Sun Protection to keep you protected from the heat. In the fishing scene, the key elements are comfort, durability, and protection. That’s why they have a lightweight texture to give you easy maneuverability, which makes shirts convenient for many other outdoor activities like hiking or sports.

## <a name="FishingShirtsTypes"> Fishing Shirts Types</a>

When choosing your fishing shirts, there are many different types and styles you can go for, but they all fall within two categories, according to Style and Fabric.
According to the sleeve style, we get Long Sleeves and Short Sleeves with lightweight material. They adjust to every body size and offer easy maneuverability when you are swinging that fishing reel. The Long Sleeves one comes with UPF+50 Sun Protection against sunburn in high-temperature conditions. We also have a button-down type of shirt that comes with adjustable cuffs with extended plackets. They are useful for anglers to store any fishing equipment when needed.
The other category is the fabric of these shirts. First, we have Polyester and then Nylon. They are both easy to watch clothes with lightweight and durable qualities. The wrinkle-resistant texture is also useful. Now the difference is that the Polyester dries and dye faster while the Nylon is stronger and softer but takes longer to dry when it’s wet. There are also cotton shirts which are great for hot weather and all other climates. However, the problem is that tears more often.
