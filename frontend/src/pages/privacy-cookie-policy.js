          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Integral</strong> — The use of HTTPS preserves the integrity
            of data. Your data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Authenticated</strong> — HTTPS protocol authenticates your

            To help ensure that You receive ads that are relevant to Your
            interests on the Website, Our advertisers&rsquo; services, and
            elsewhere on the Internet, We and third parties (including service
            providers, advertisers, and advertising companies) may collect
            information about Your online activities over time and across
            different sites, apps, and devices. We and third parties may use
            that information to help understand audience segments. Advertisers
            may use the segments to determine the audience groups to which they
            wish to deliver particular ads. Through this process, We do not use
            information that directly identifies You.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Opt Out</strong>. You can opt out of receiving
            interest-based advertising on Your computer or laptop from some
            companies, including Us and Our service providers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If You wish to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on
            Your mobile device, please see the advertising preferences
            information on support.apple.com for iOS devices or
            support.google.com for Android devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opting out does not mean You will no longer receive advertising. It
            means that the company or companies from which You opted out will no
            longer deliver ads tailored to Your web preferences and usage
            patterns.

          <p>
            Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes
            to this Privacy Policy, which We may update from time to time. If We

            In the event that the modifications materially alter Your rights or
            obligations hereunder, We will make reasonable efforts to notify You
            of the change. For example, We may send a message to Your email
            address, if We have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar
            notification when You access the Website for the first time after
            such material changes are made. If You do not refuse the changes in
            writing before they become effective, this shall mean that You have
            consented to the Privacy Policy as changed. Your continued use of
